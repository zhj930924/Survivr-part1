How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I applied metaprogramming to creating the different color methods. The inputs are from a "color: code" pairs hash and the outputs are defined color methods.

How long did you spend working on this project?
-----------------------------------------------
About 4 hours. I took Walter's lesson learning markdown as well as watched a few online posts about metaprogramming.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
----------------------------------------------------
Metaprogramming itself is difficult to digest. May need more practice. Things like self in different scopes can be very confusing. I'm still not good at applying it to my daily life - still feel uncomfortable.

Where do you still have room to grow?
-------------------------------------
Metaprogramming - maybe need to do more practical examples.
